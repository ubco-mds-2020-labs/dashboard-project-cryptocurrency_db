## Things that went well

#### Milestone 1
- We spent most of the time on the research of the dashboard and the target audience. We stuck to our goals and were aligned with the amount of the required to spend on the project

#### Milestone 2
- We were comfortable with the dataset, and build a basic dashboard for audience who are interested in exploring the cryptoworld. We had to perform a lot of wrangling to make sure the data adjusts the graph (instead of graph adjusting the data)




## Things that went poorly

#### Milestone 1
- We are concerned about the performance of the dashboard and our ability to create it on time. We may have to extend our working hours on the project
- We are working with larger dataset, so it has slowed down our dashboard
- We didn't have a template to work with so we tried creating our own
