# crypocurrency_db

The app contains an executive dashbaord to give the high level summary of the cryptocurrency. This summary will contain the weekly performance like average market cap, best 5 cryptocurrency of the week, upcoming cryptocurrency etc.

Below the summary we will have filter(drop down)/check box/tree chart to drill down individual cryptocurrency and month and year to see Month on Month comparison.

We will also have a linear trend line, 3-days moving average and 7 days moving average line to compare the highest rate per day.

We also plan to incorporate a mini histogram with last 7 days of data. We want to stick to red and green colours to have traffic light comparison. 

We will also include a exchange rate table with 5 popular currency (CAD, INR, YEN, CNY, USD) so that people wish to transact with so that if an individual is interested in a particular cryptocurrency, he/she/they should know how much to dig in their pockets.
