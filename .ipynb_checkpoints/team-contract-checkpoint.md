# Goals

1. To make a dashboard for the cryptocurrency. This dashboard should be interactive and aligned with the needs of the target audience
2. To understand how the different cryptocurrency behaves, what are the top-performing cryptocurrency and how much should an individual spend to buy one unit of the cryptocurrency
3. The primary obstacle that we may face is the best layout for the design

# Meeting Norms

1. Since the members work at different timezone, two meetings will be held
    a. 6:30 am to 7:00 am PST
    b. 7:30 pm to 8:00 pm PST
2. Meetings will be over slack/google meet
3. If the members are interested in doing more research than required for the project, they are allowed to spend more time and schedule extra meetings
4. Meetings will not be recorded, however, import tasks or minutes of the meetings are encouraged

# Work Norms

1. 60-120 minutes from Mon-Fri should be dedicated to this project. If the other person is not available, it should be informed in advance
2. Every alternate day the other member will review the work
3. In case there is a delay in submitting the task, the  member has to spend extra time in the week to work on it
4. Tasks will be divided based on the interests
5. If there is a difference of opinion, the owner of the task takes the decision
6. Google docs/GitHub/slack can be used for communication
7. If members finish our desired task before the deadline, they are encouraged to explore more ideas for improvement of the dashboard
8. In an unlikely event, if the member is unable to finish the task, TA/instructor should be informed

# Decision Making

1. Decisions should be based only on data
2. In case of conflict, the priority will be 
    a. time - Is the implementation of the idea of going to take less than 60 mins? If yes, we can test the implementation as long as the idea is provided at least 2 days before the deadline of each milestone
    b. impact - Is the implementation of the idea aligned with the goals? If yes, we go back to point 'a'
    c. cost - Does the implementation of the idea requires the team member to learn additional concept/skill for more than 45 mins per day? If yes, we should skip the idea
3. Encourage and explore other interpretation of the idea
4. Listen openly to the other point of view
5. Acknowledge valid points that other person has made
6. List down all the ideas (no matter how difficult they are) to track if they are implemented or not. 
4. Since there are only 2 members, the owner of the idea/task decides the next steps. However, if the other participant feels that the decision made was not correct or needs more thought process, she can ask other colleagues (who are not involved in the project) for their unbiased opinion
